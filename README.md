## Johnson Counter ##
#### Introduction ####
Ring counter is like a shift counter where the output of the last flip-flop is connected to the input of the first flip-flop.
With a certain type of connections and changing ORI(over ride inputs), clock pulse forms a ring like structure. Thus the
name ”Ring counter”. Johnson’s counter is a modified ring counter. In this counter,
the complimented output of the last flip-flop is given as the input to the first flip-flop. Johnson’s counter consists
of a common clock to activate all the flip-flops, so it is a
synchronous counter. For a 4 bit counter, 4 D flip-flops are used. In a Johnson’s
counter, the number of states is double the number of flip-flops used unlike a ring counter where number of flip-flops used is
same as the number of states. This is an advantage for the Johnson’s counter.
